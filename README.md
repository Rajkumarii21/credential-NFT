# Dev Bootcamp Credential NFT

## 1. Project Title
**Dev Bootcamp Credential NFT â€“ Issue to Graduates**

## 2. Project Description
This smart contract allows a coding bootcamp to issue **non-transferable NFTs** as credentials to verified graduates. Each NFT represents a verifiable proof of completion, uniquely tied to the recipient's wallet address.

These NFTs (also known as **soulbound tokens**) cannot be transferred or traded, ensuring that only the rightful graduate holds the credential. The bootcamp administrator (contract deployer) is the only one authorized to issue these credentials.

## 3. Project Vision
To establish a decentralized and trustworthy credentialing system for bootcamps and educational institutions. By using Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, graduates gain immutable proof of their achievements, while employers and platforms gain an easy way to verify those credentials.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Metadata expansion**: Store dynamic fields like course title, score, or completion date.
- **Revocation support**: Enable credential removal or deactivation in rare cases.
- **Verification UI**: Develop a frontend where employers can verify credentials by wallet address or token ID.
- **On-chain reputation**: Link credentials to a larger system of professional reputation or DAO governance eligibility.
